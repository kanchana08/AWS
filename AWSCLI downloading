[] .'. sudo apt  install awscli
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Package awscli is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'awscli' has no installation candidate

       To Fix that:

[] sudo snap install aws-cli --classic
[] aws --version
aws-cli/1.16.266 Python/3.5.2 Linux/5.0.0-37-generic botocore/1.13.2
